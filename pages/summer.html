title: Summer pre-game, i.e. get access to MIMIC data, domain reading
---

<p>This is summer and we should keep things lite, but it is really important that everyione tries to gain access to the data so we can hit the ground running in the fall. I also want to make sure there is some baseline knowledge about the domain and data, so please try to take care of the tasks labeled <i>critical</i>.</p>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Topics</h2>
<p>You will be touching on these topics over the summer</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>What is sepsis, how it can be diagnosed/treated and why it is very deadly</li>
  <li>The MIMIC dataset and where it comes from</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Tasks</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
