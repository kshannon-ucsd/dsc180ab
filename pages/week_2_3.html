title: Dive into the MIMIC-III dataset + EDA
---

<p>Welcome, Welcome, Welcome!</p>
<p>These next two weeks will be focused on setting up the MIMIC-III dataset to run locally, and exploring the data. Get comfortable with the different tables and perform some light EDA.</p>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Topics</h2>
<p>You will be touching on these topics over the first week</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Learning about EHR data</li>
  <li>How EHR data is processed into a DB</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Tasks</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Each team member should focus on performing their own EDA</li>
  <li>Complete all assigned readings</li>
  <li>Continue to familairize yourself with the domain by thumbing through the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/domain" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Domain Expertise</a> page <span class="ml-3 bg-red-500 text-white text-sm font-bold py-0.5 px-3 rounded-md">critical</span></li>
  <li>Submit question answers to the online form (linked below)</li>
  <li>Try to calculate some illness scores (e.g. SOFA) for some patients, see how this process might work</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Readings & Videos</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
    <li>Again, read the capstone primary paper by <i>Zador et al.</i> linked on the home page. Take good notes, and begin to explore some of the key papers in the references.</li>
    <li>Watch this video presentation on the MIMIC-III database <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbz6jFcyryQ" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">link</a></li>
    <li>Watch this lecture on deep diving into clinical data with MIMIC. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UFwGJe6ubg" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">link</a> You can also try to reproduce some of the EDA and analysis in this video by using the MIMIC dataset</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Questions</h2>
<p>Answer the following questions using this <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="{{ site.data.variables.questions_link }}">google form link</a></p>
<ol class="list-decimal pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
    <li>From the MIT OpenCourseWare lecture, what key insights and knowledge did you gain regarding clinical data?</li>
    <li>Describe any challenges you encountered while setting up the MIMIC-III dataset on your local machine. How did you address and resolve these challenges?</li>
    <li>Please provide an overview of the steps and methodologies involved in transforming raw EHR data into the structured format of the MIMIC dataset. Note that you may need to conduct additional research through online sources for comprehensive information.</li>
    <li>Were you successful in calculating illness scores for any of the patients in the dataset? Elaborate on the process you followed and discuss any challenges faced along the way.</li>
  </ol>
