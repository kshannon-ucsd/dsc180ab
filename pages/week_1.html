title: Summer pre-game, i.e. get access to MIMIC data, domain reading
---



<p>This is summer and we should keep things lite, but it is really important that everyione tries to gain access to the data so we can hit the ground running in the fall. I also want to make sure there is some baseline knowledge about the domain and data, so please try to take care of the tasks labeled <i>critical</i>.</p>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Topics</h2>
<p>You will be touching on these topics over the summer</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>What is sepsis, how it can be diagnosed/treated and why it is very deadly</li>
  <li>The MIMIC dataset and where it comes from</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Tasks</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Gain access to the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV dataset, see instructions on home page<span class="ml-3 bg-red-500 text-white text-sm font-bold py-0.5 px-3 rounded-md">critical</span></li>
  <li>Complete both assigned readings</li>
  <li>If you feel up to it, read the domain readings on sepsis and ICU care in the "Additional Resources" section on the week 1 page</li>
  <li>If you feel up to it you can also read the capstone primary paper by <i>Zador et al.</i> linked on the home page</li>
</ul>

The Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score are all used to assess the severity of illness in patients, particularly those in intensive care units (ICU). They are often used to predict mortality rates and to guide treatment decisions. Here's a brief comparison:

Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS): This score is calculated using 10 variables, including age, vital signs, and Glasgow Coma Scale. It is used to predict the mortality of ICU patients. Studies have shown that there are no significant differences between OASIS, APACHE II, and SAPS II in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with acute kidney injury (source).

Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II): This score is calculated using 17 variables, including age, type of admission, and three physiological variables. It is used to predict the probability of mortality in ICU patients. The SAPS II has been compared to other scoring systems like APACHE II and SOFA, and it has been found to be effective in assessing mortality in surgical patients with sepsis (source).

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score: This score is calculated based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. It is used to track a patient's status during the stay in an ICU. The SOFA score has been found to be effective in assessing the condition and predicting the mortality of ICU patients (source).

It's important to note that while these scores are helpful in predicting outcomes and guiding treatment decisions, they are not definitive. The patient's individual condition and response to treatment also play a significant role.
