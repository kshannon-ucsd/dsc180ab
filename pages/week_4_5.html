title: Begin data preprocessing and learn about Elixhauser comorbidity index
---

<p>These next few weeks we will take the knowledge we have learned from working a little bit with MIMIC-III and begin to work on replicating the paper's findings.First part of this is to preprocess data required for the analysis.</p>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Topics</h2>
<p>You will be touching on the following topics.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Elixhauser comorbidity index</li>
  <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
  <li>Working on a replication pipeline</li>
  <li>combining replication efforts within your team (e.g. git/github)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Tasks</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Create a materialized or virtual view of that datatable(s) you need to perform this analysis</li>
  <li>Begin to process data and work from the methods section of the capstone paper</li>
  <li>Continue to familairize yourself with the domain as needed. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/domain" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Domain Expertise Page</a></li>
  <li>Submit question answers to the online form (linked below)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Questions</h2>
<p>Answer the following questions using this <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="{{ site.data.variables.questions_link }}">google form link</a></p>
<ol class="list-decimal pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>What steps have you taken in preprocessing the data?</li>
  <li>What challenges have you encountered in data preprocessing and how have you addressed them?</li>
  <li>How has the data changed after preprocessing? What impact do you expect this to have on the analysis?</li>
</ol>
