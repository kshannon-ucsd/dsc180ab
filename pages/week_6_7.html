title: Start implementing k-means and LCA
---

<p>The goal for these next few weeks is to begin performing the analysis and get a handle on the methods portion of the paper.</p>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Topics</h2>
<p>You will be touching on the following topics.</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Applying k-means to clinical data</li>
  <li>Implmenting an LCA analysis</li>
  <li>Replicating results from a paper</li>
  <li>Presenting your preliminary replication findings</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Tasks</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>Continue to familairize yourself with the domain as needed. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/domain" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Domain Expertise Page</a></li>
  <li>Complete implementing k-means and LCA analysis, check out some of the resources I have to help learn about LCA (resources page)</li>
  <li>Take another look at the capstone paper, specifically the methods section.</li>
  <li>Each group will put together a short (~6-8 slides) presentation on the results of their k-means clusrtering and LCA analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-4xl text-gray-800 font-thin mb-3 mt-8">Mini Presentation</h2>
<p>Make sure your short presentation addresses the following questions</p>
<ol class="list-decimal pl-5 ml-4 space-y-1">
  <li>What results have you obtained from applying k-means clustering to the data?</li>
  <li>What was the result of your LCA analysis?</li>
  <li>Discuss your attempt at replication, what challanges have you faced, what victories have you had?</li>
  <li>How do these results compare with those reported in the paper so far?</li>
</ol>
